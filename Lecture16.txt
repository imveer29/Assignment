What is an Algorithm? Algorithm Basics
The word Algorithm means ” A set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in 
calculations or other problem-solving operations ” Or ” A procedure for solving a 
mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves recursive operations”.

What is the need for algorithms:
1.Algorithms are necessary for solving complex problems efficiently and effectively. 

2.They help to automate processes and make them more reliable, faster, and easier to perform.

3.Algorithms also enable computers to perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to do manually.

4.They are used in various fields such as mathematics, computer science, engineering, finance, and
 many others to optimize processes, analyze data, make predictions, and provide solutions to problems.

Properties of Algorithm:
It should terminate after a finite time.
It should produce at least one output.
It should take zero or more input.
It should be deterministic means giving the same output for the same input case.
Every step in the algorithm must be effective i.e. every step should do some work.

Types of Algorithms:
There are several types of algorithms available. Some important algorithms are:

1. Brute Force Algorithm: It is the simplest approach for a problem. A brute force algorithm 
is the first approach that comes to finding when we see a problem.

2. Recursive Algorithm: A recursive algorithm is based on recursion. In this case, a problem is
 broken into several sub-parts and called the same function again and again.
